## What is Snake Island?
Snake Island is an action-adventure story game where an ambitious explorer battles his way through an island that has been long abandoned, left for its native inhabitants: the highly venomous golden lancehead pit viper. 

The explorer must trek through a treacherous, sneak-infested jungle to find his way to the center of the island. Deep in the depths of the island's core will he find the Key that will let him escape back to the mainland.

As the player, you will have to fend off deadly vipers while maneuvering through the environment. But do not fret, you have a radio directly connected to your team back at the mainland that will be guiding you along the way. 

Good luck adventurer. You will need it...
